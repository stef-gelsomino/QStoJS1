	<h2>Common Operators</h2>
	<table>
		<tr>
    		<td>+</td>
    		<td>Addition: returns the sum of two numbers, if they are both numbers. When adding two values that are not numbers, it concatenates, or combines, the two values into a string</td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td>-</td>
  			<td>Subtraction: returns the result of the first number, minus the second. Can also be used to indicate a negative value</td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td>*</td>
  			<td>Multiplication: returns the result of two values multiplied together</td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td>/</td>
  			<td>Division: returns thew result of the first value divided by the second</td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td>%</td>
  			<td>Modulo: returns the remainder of the first value divided by the second</td>
  		</tr>
	</table>	
	<p>The order of execution of the operations in the expressions respects the arithmetic rules.</p> <p>See examples in the "main.js" file.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Console</h2>
	<p>The web-console is a tool thet provides information about the code that is running on a webpage. It gives feedback like messages, errors and warnings; it also allows us to test additional code with JavaScript that is currently running in the page.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Primitive Data Types</h2>
	<p>There are several types of data used in JavaScript that serve as the basic building blocks of every program. These are called <span class="stout">primitive data types</span> and consists of the following types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>String</li>
		<li>Number</li>
		<li>Boolean</li>
		<li>Null</li>
		<li>Undefined</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Any <span class="stout">expression</span> in JavaScript will return a <span class="stout">value</span> (e.g. 2 + 2 returns 4), and that value will have a <span class="stout">type</span>. For example, the result of 2 + 2 is 4 and 4’ś data type is a nunmber. If yuo add 2 + "2", the result is "22", and "22" is a string.</p>
	<p>A values’s <span class="stout">type</span> tells us what kind of "thing" it is.</p>
	<p>"Null" and "Undefined" are weird types.</p>
	<p>See examples in the "main.js" file.</p>
